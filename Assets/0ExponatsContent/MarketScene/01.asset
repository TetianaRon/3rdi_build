  Description: "Pieter Aertsen, 1569 year, Dutch\n\nThe Painting has no religious
    undertones, as many of Aertsen\xB4s work had, but divulges a highly erotic subject
    where the saucy looking woman holding a cabbage head \u2013 a symbol of female
    sexuality \u2013 bending forward in order do display her breasts to the viewer.
    The man holdning a carrot, and thus hinting rather unsubtly at his sexual capacity,
    also points towards the group of vegetables directly opposite the cabbage head:
    two spherical tomatoes and a veined, upright cucumber."
