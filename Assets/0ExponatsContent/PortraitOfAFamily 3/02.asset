  Description: "Arent Arentsz, Dutch\n\nThe family stands on the bank of a river
    in front of what presumably is their house. The people in the picture are clearly
    divided into two groups, masters and servants. The gentry is depicted in all
    their finer clothes while the others - with faces coarsened and darkened by outdoor
    work \u2013 stand in the background or to one side.\r\nAs Arentsz spent his whole
    career in Amsterdam and did not travel far afield, the river may well be the
    Ij and the location a village close to Amserdam. The topographical depiction
    and de squatness of the figures are typical of his early Amsterdam work.\r\nThe
    family portrait in the Hallwyl Collection is the only known family portrait by
    Arent Arentsz. Although its composition clearly follows the rest of his production
    as far as can be ascertained by comparing his works in other museums. Arentsz
    normally painted on elongated panels like this one and mostly restricted himself
    to painting fishermen and water front scenes."
